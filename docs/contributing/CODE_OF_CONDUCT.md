\page code_of_conduct Code of Conduct

This file outlines the expectations for contributing to PowerBlocks.  
The goal is simple: keep the project healthy, original, and enjoyable to work on.

# General Tone
Be civil, stay on-topic, and respect others’ time and effort.

We can disagree, and you are absolutely allowed to tell me when I'm wrong — I’ll do the same when needed.  
Just keep feedback constructive and centered on the work, not the person.

Avoid insults, drama, or personal attacks.  
Direct, honest and open communication is welcome; hostility is not.

Put effort into your discussions.  
Thoughtful questions and reasoned responses help everyone understand each other and make better decisions.
# Original Work Only
PowerBlocks is an original SDK. To protect both contributors and the project:

- Only submit **your own code**.
- Do **not** copy code, assets, or documentation from commercial SDKs or proprietary sources.
- When re-implementing functionality that exists elsewhere, make sure your code is:
  - original  
  - your own interpretation  
  - not a line-for-line derivative  
  - adding value beyond the source  

Avoid referencing other codebases directly while implementing; focus on understanding the behavior and creating your own solution.

This also applies to non-code assets such as 3D models, audio, documentation, and examples.

We want PowerBlocks to stay legally safe, clean, and something everyone can confidently use.
