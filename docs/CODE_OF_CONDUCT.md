# Code of Conduct
This file just has the general conduct when contributing to PowerBlocks.

TL;DR don't steel code and be mature.

## General Tone
In general be civil. Keep discussion related to PowerBlocks.

Don't be afraid to say I am wrong. You can call me out on my BS, and I will call you out on your BS.

Just try to be agreeable, you don't have to name call or ad hominem go after people with dramatic comments. Just be to the point and constructive.

Provided reasoned responses and counter arguments where needed.

## Post Your Stuff
Definitely with wii homebrew, be careful to post only your own original code. Don't copy in code or documentation from SDKs.

When implementing functions from other code bases, just make sure that your code is unique, adds value, and is not a direct derivate work.

This also includes other media like 3D models and audio.
