Please read this quick document before contributing.

I apologize if its a bit ranty.

To be expanded with formatting in the futures.

## Overview
As it tends to be with homebrew projects. Please, please, **please** be careful where you source your code and code related things from. Please do not ever plagiarize code. This includes propriety software through reverse engineering, or open source software in a way that breaks the license.

This also means avoiding code bases that may have used stolen code. This goes for headers as well. Do not copy in documentation from these, or make headers with the exact same function and documentation.

Offer new and original code, or code based from a reputable source, as compared to trying to tip tow around tainted code.

### How to Get Good Code
When writing code for PowerBlocks, I acknowledge that in order to understand the hardware, you have to work apart how software interacts with the system and why.

Your goal should be to know why code does something, not how code does something. If you can implement the why and leave the how out, by experimenting with the system and figuring out each detail, make your own unique implementation, and possibly find better solutions than there were previous!

Please do not worry about offering functionality similar to that of other tools. Try to provide tools that can accomplish the same goals, but do not try and copy their exact method.

At the end of the day it can be a lot more tricky and broken at times to write code for a system without documentation and through experimentation and from what you can peace together from how it actually works, but in the end the quality of this code is much higher.

### Keeping Things Clean
I know that it is inevitable that legally unsound code can make it into projects like these. Please do not be silent about concerns about code from me or others being possibly tainted. I really am writing this to do the best I can to deliver on a need for a solid foundation for wii homebrew build on trust, so I will do the best I can to resolve these.

The entirety of Wii Homebrew still exist, so of course much of it will make it into this projects, and with issues of code theft running so deep it can be tuff. 

There is a massive gray aria around this, so I can not guarantee everyone will feel the same on these things, but its still better to have these discussions than not at all.

### Note to the Past
Its without a question this project exist because of the whole devkitpro libogc thing. Though id been gathering up the desire to do this project long before, I don't think I would of ever made it entirely independent had this not happened.

I do not want to attack devkitpro or libogc with this. They were my childhood in a way. I don't know any of this personally and am pretty much an outsider to it all. I want to provide a platform for homebrew people can feel confident using.

I greatly appreciate any contribution to the project you can make. Keep Hacking.
