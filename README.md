# PowerBlocks SDK
PowerBlocks is a fully independent SDK for Wii homebrew development designed from the ground up. It does not aim to serve as a direct stand in but offers the functionality needed for homebrew projects.

This project is currently deep within development. Please feel free to contribute and check out CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Getting Started
You can use a release of the SDK from the releases section, or build from source. For the windows setup its recommended to use MSYS2. To build from source, check BUILDING.md.

Once a version of the SDK is ready. Check out the examples folder.
